# Real-Time Fake News Detection using Machine Learning and NLP

This project is a real-time Fake News Detection web application that identifies whether news content is real or fake using machine learning models trained on real-world datasets. The system uses natural language processing techniques and multiple classification algorithms to provide accurate predictions through a web-based interface.
